## About Me: Volleyball Dad üèê

As a proud Volleyball Dad, I take on a variety of responsibilities to ensure my player has the best support both on and off the court. Here's an overview of what I do:

- **Transportation & Scheduling**: I coordinate travel arrangements, including chauffeuring my player to practices and tournaments, ensuring we arrive early and are always prepared. I handle hotel bookings according to the tournament's "Stay to Play" policies and add all travel details, including hotel stays, to the family Google calendar.  
- **Videography & Photography**: I record every game and share edited footage through my personal YouTube channel, making sure to capture the best angles in accordance with **Balltime**‚Äôs best practices. I collaborate with other parents who may be recording games to ensure optimal footage and smooth sharing.  
- **Social Media & Communication**: I manage my player‚Äôs Instagram profile, posting game clips and tournament highlights to keep family and friends updated. I also use **Linktr.ee** to share tournament details and schedules with everyone who wants to stay informed.  
- **Training Support & Equipment**: I support my player‚Äôs training by purchasing the necessary equipment and seeking outside specialists to improve specific skills. I also interface with coaches through one-on-one meetings to understand areas of improvement and work on developing those skills.  
- **Club Coordination & Financials**: I manage club fees, schedule payments, and keep track of clinic and tryout dates. I make sure all the financials are in order so my player can focus on training and competitions.  
- **Emotional Support & Motivation**: I‚Äôm always there with a positive pep talk, encouraging words, and unwavering support for my player‚Äôs growth and performance.  

This GitHub repository serves as a way for me to document and track all the various aspects of my Volleyball Dad journey and responsibilities.
